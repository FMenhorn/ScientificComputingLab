## TODO's


*	DONE ~copy worksheet to folder~
*	DONE ~Hasnain and Chip- impliment part~ 
*	DONE ~Felix- impliment the Gaus Seidel Solver~
*	DONE ~Felix- impliment the Matlab solver for d1)~
*	Write the outputs in a better format (with exponents for clear visualization)
*	Code review and refine the commenting, variable names and syntax if possible.
*	Check whether the storage is calculated correctly or not. Most of the values look same in table
*	Confirm the extent of time estimates (time for A and B generation to be included or not). Correct if needed
*	Confirm the extent of storage, which variables should be considered..
*	Compare the results with another group.
*	Fill the worksheet.
*	Upload project, discuss preferences for timeslot and choose time slot.

###Open questions:
 
*	What is internally happening with solving opposed to linsolve? It is even faster!!! Why???
*	So, why is Sparse so incredibly fast and for that, why not always just using sparse matrices intead of iterative scheme?
